       <p> <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Hate-Crimes/bqiq-cu78" > Data published by the New York City Police Department</a> (NYPD) reveals that out of all reported bias motives for hate crimes committed across the city over the past four years, those based in antisemitism come out on top. Antisemitic hate crimes from January 2019 to October 2022 have totaled to 750 individual reports from across all five boroughs, followed by anti-Asian hate crimes which totaled to 238 reported incidents. New York state comes first in the nation for the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/hate-empire-state-extremism-antisemitism-new-york-2020-2021" >highest number of antisemitic-based incidents</a>, which include but are not limited to acts such as hate crimes and harassment. <br>

       <p> The NYPD records the bias motive of each reported hate crime incident in its database. Those pertaining exclusively to anti-religion based sentiments outweighed hate crimes committed across the city based in anti-race/ethnicity, anti-LGBTQ+, and anti-gender motives. This lead held by anti-religion bias motives can be attributed to the large amount of antisemitic hate crimes reported to the NYPD, with antisemitic hate crimes making up 89 percent of the anti-religion category. </p>

       <p> Antisemitism has been on the rise across the country due to a wide variety of reasons. Mitchell Silber, the executive director of the <a href="https://www.jcrcny.org/"> Jewish Community Relations Center </a> in New York City, attributes this rise in antisemitism to the increased confidence individuals have with sharing their extremist views to the public. A recent example comes in the form of Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, who has made a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-63833338" > series of antisemitic comments </a> on social media and during interviews. Despite being removed from various platforms, his words continue to influence his followers into subscribing to similar beliefs. At the end of October, a group of individuals hung a series of antisemitic signs over a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/live/#x"> highway overpass </a> as a form of solidarity with the rapper’s sentiments. </p>

       <p>Another source of aggression and hate against the Jewish community of New York comes from <a href="https://nynj.adl.org/news/2021-audit-ny/">white supremacy groups</a>. In 2021, there were 212 documented incidents in New York State in which these groups spread various forms of harmful propaganda. Twenty of these incidents involved some type of antisemitic imagery or phrase. Many of these groups support racist and antisemitic ideas such as ensuring white Europeans are not overtaken by other religious and ethnic groups</p>

       <p> Of all reported antisemitic hate crimes across the city’s five boroughs, the highest amount was reported out of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has long been home to New York City’s largest Jewish population, with <a href="https://brooklynjewish.org/2022/06/jewish-population-is-up-in-the-new-york-region/">78 percent</a> of individuals identifying as Jewish. In areas throughout the borough, various <a href="https://www.pbs.org/alifeapart/intro_2.html">Orthodox Jewish</a> communities have grown and flourished for decades. Silber explains the high amount of hate crimes against Jewish people reported out of Brooklyn could be due to the borough having a larger Jewish population than the others. Among this population, Silber explains how more people in this borough are likely to wear traditional articles of clothing that make them stand out when compared to non-Jewish individuals. </p>

       <p> Antisemitic attacks on Jewish individuals are not a new problem. Throughout history, members of the Jewish population have been the subject of numerous hate-fueled actions, which in turn have led to a wide variety of efforts over the years to combat such aggression. In the early twentieth century, the American Jewish Committee <a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/confronting-hate-1937-1952">launched a media campaign </a> that aimed to create a series of political cartoons to call out antisemitism in the media. The campaign expanded to soon include fighting against other forms of hatred such as racism and nativism.</p>

        <p> Today, efforts to combat this rise of hate against New York City’s Jewish population have included a variety of actions taken by the local government. In 2019, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/640-19/mayor-de-blasio-launches-new-crime-prevention-efforts-combat-hate-anti-semitism">series of measures </a> that include increasing NYPD patrols in specific neighborhoods and the establishment of neighborhood safety coalitions. To combat hate crimes in general, the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/stophate/about/about.page">Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes</a> was established in New York City in January 2019. This office aims to provide non-law enforcement solutions, such as increased public education and community outreach efforts, to reduce the amount of hate crimes that occur across the city. </p>

       <p> Various organizations working to limit the amount of antisemitism have also established branches in the city, such as the aforementioned Jewish Community Relations Council. The <a href="https://nynj.adl.org/about/" >Anti-Defamation League </a> has established a center that focuses primarily on acts of hate committed in New York City and New Jersey.</p>

       <p> As recently as April 2022, <a href="https://www.jta.org/2022/09/19/ny/as-antisemitic-hate-crimes-rise-city-offers-new-training-in-understanding-jewish-experiences">a new initiative</a> led by the City’s Commission on Human Rights aims to tackle the issue of antisemitism through education. The training provided through this initiative focuses on providing New Yorkers with the tools to better understand antisemitism in the city around them. The goal is that through this education, everyday New Yorkers will be able to identify antisemitism and help bring it to an end. </p>
